/// Tests for `EventSubClient` lifecycle correctness:
///
/// 1. **Deinit reachability** — the client's long-running tasks (path-monitor
///    loop, keepalive watchdog) capture `self` weakly and re-acquire it per
///    step, so they must not retain the client while suspended. A regression
///    here makes `deinit` unreachable and leaks the client (plus its socket)
///    forever.
/// 2. **Cancellation-aware welcome waits** — `connect(timeout:)` enforces its
///    deadline by cancelling the welcome wait inside a task group, and the
///    group must then *await* the cancelled child. A welcome continuation that
///    ignored cancellation would block the group until a socket error or late
///    welcome arrived — potentially minutes past the deadline.
///
/// These tests drive the private machinery directly through small internal
/// test-only seams (`armKeepaliveForTesting`, `waitForWelcomeForTesting`,
/// `deliverWelcomeForTesting`), following the precedent of
/// `setConnectBodyForTesting` — deliberately below the `socketFactory` seam
/// (see EventSubSocketTests), so each property is pinned in isolation.
