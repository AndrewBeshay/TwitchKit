TwitchKit is a Swift Package for working with the Twitch Helix API, Twitch OAuth, and EventSub WebSocket transport from modern Swift apps.

The package is currently pre-1.0. It provides typed authentication, token storage, Helix request helpers, EventSub subscription builders, and EventSub WebSocket delivery while the public API continues to settle.

## Requirements

- Swift 6.0 or newer
- iOS 16 or newer
- macOS 13 or newer

## Installation

Add TwitchKit as a Swift Package dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/AndrewBeshay/TwitchKit.git", from: "0.2.3")
```

Then add the product to your target:

```swift
.product(name: "TwitchKit", package: "TwitchKit")
```

## Quick Start

```swift
import TwitchKit

let twitch = TwitchClient(
    clientId: "<your client id>",
    tokenNamespace: "primary-account"
)

let authURL = twitch.auth.implicitGrantURL(
    scopes: [
        .userReadEmail,
        .userReadChat,
        .userWriteChat,
    ],
    state: "<csrf token>"
)
```

For server-backed apps that can protect a client secret:

```swift
let twitch = TwitchClient(
    clientId: "<your client id>",
    clientSecret: "<your client secret>",
    tokenNamespace: "primary-account"
)

let authURL = twitch.auth.authorizationCodeURL(
    scopes: [
        .userReadEmail,
        .channelManageBroadcast,
    ],
    state: "<csrf token>"
)
```

After your app receives an authorization code:

```swift
try await twitch.auth.authenticate(withAuthorizationCode: code)
```

If your host app or backend owns OAuth, inject an existing token:

```swift
try await twitch.auth.setToken(
    OAuthToken(
        accessToken: "<access token>",
        refreshToken: nil,
        expiresIn: nil,
        scope: nil,
        tokenType: "bearer"
    )
)
```

## Helix API

```swift
let user = try await twitch.api.fetchUser()
let channel = try await twitch.api.fetchChannelInfo(forBroadcasterID: user.id)
let emotes = try await twitch.api.fetchGlobalEmotes()
```

Current Helix coverage includes users, channels, streams, games, chat, moderation, EventSub management, ads, analytics, Bits, conduits, entitlements, extensions, Guest Star, followed channels/streams, channel editors, search, schedules, charity, Hype Train, polls, predictions, raids, stream markers, goals, channel points rewards/redemptions, subscriptions, clips, tags, teams, videos, and whispers.

Paginated endpoints are available as either single pages or lazy async sequences:

```swift
let firstPage = try await twitch.api.fetchChannelFollowersPage(
    forBroadcasterID: user.id,
    first: 100
)

for try await follower in twitch.api.channelFollowers(forBroadcasterID: user.id) {
    print("Follower:", follower.userName)
}
```

Sending a chat message:

```swift
let result = try await twitch.api.sendChatMessage(
    broadcasterId: "<broadcaster id>",
    senderId: "<sender id>",
    message: "Hello from TwitchKit"
)

if result.isSent {
    print("Sent message:", result.messageId)
}
```

## EventSub WebSocket

Connect to EventSub and subscribe to typed subscription requests:

```swift
try await twitch.eventSub.connect()

try await twitch.eventSub.subscribe(
    .makeChannelChatMessage(
        broadcasterID: "<broadcaster id>",
        userID: "<user id>"
    )
)

for await event in twitch.eventSub.events {
    switch event {
    case .chatMessage(let message):
        print("\(message.chatterUserName): \(message.message.text)")

    case .follow(let follow):
        print("New follower:", follow.userName)

    case .subscription(let subscription):
        print("New subscription:", subscription.userName)

    case .revocation(let revocation):
        print("Subscription revoked:", revocation.status)

    case .unknown(let type, _):
        print("Unhandled EventSub event:", type)
    }
}
```

EventSub reconnects automatically and re-creates desired subscriptions after a full disconnect. Duplicate EventSub messages are ignored by message ID. TwitchKit bounds duplicate-message tracking and buffers the newest 1,000 EventSub notifications by default so a slow consumer cannot grow memory without limit.

If your app needs a different EventSub buffering tradeoff, configure the client at initialization:

```swift
let twitch = TwitchClient(
    clientId: "<#Client ID#>",
    eventBufferingPolicy: .bufferingNewest(5_000)
)
```

`subscribe(_:)` returns the `EventSubSubscriptionRecord` created by Twitch, including the subscription ID. Keep that ID if you want to remove the subscription later:

```swift
let record = try await twitch.eventSub.subscribe(
    .makeChannelChatMessage(
        broadcasterID: "<#Broadcaster ID#>",
        userID: "<#User ID#>"
    )
)

try await twitch.eventSub.unsubscribe(id: record.id)
```

You can also manage EventSub subscriptions directly through Helix:

```swift
let page = try await twitch.api.fetchEventSubSubscriptionsPage(
    filter: .status(.enabled)
)

try await twitch.api.deleteEventSubSubscription(id: page.data[0].id)

let deletedCount = try await twitch.api.deleteAllEventSubSubscriptions(
    filter: .status(.webhookCallbackVerificationPending)
)
```

### EventSub Webhooks

For webhook transports, verify Twitch's signature before decoding or acting on a notification. Pass the exact raw request body bytes you received from your HTTP server:

```swift
let verifier = EventSubWebhookVerifier(secret: eventSubSecret)
let isValid = verifier.isValid(
    messageID: request.headers["Twitch-Eventsub-Message-Id"],
    timestamp: request.headers["Twitch-Eventsub-Message-Timestamp"],
    body: requestBody,
    signature: request.headers["Twitch-Eventsub-Message-Signature"]
)

let challenge = try EventSubWebhookVerifier.challenge(from: requestBody)
```

Known EventSub subscription types that do not yet have dedicated field-level models decode as `.known(EventSubKnownEvent)` with the original JSON payload preserved. Future Twitch types decode as `.unknown(type:payload:)`.

## OAuth Support

TwitchKit exposes helpers for Twitch-supported OAuth flows:

- OAuth implicit grant
- OAuth authorization code grant
- OIDC implicit grant
- OIDC authorization code grant
- OAuth client credentials grant
- OAuth device code grant
- Token injection for apps that manage OAuth outside the package

For iOS apps, avoid shipping a client secret in the app bundle. Prefer implicit grant, device code flow, or a backend-owned authorization code exchange depending on your app model.

OAuth is split into composable pieces:

- `TwitchOAuthClient` builds OAuth URLs and exchanges grants for tokens.
- `TwitchTokenStore` abstracts token persistence.
- `KeychainTokenStore` is the default Apple-platform token store.
- `InMemoryTokenStore` is useful for tests, previews, and backend-owned OAuth.
- `TwitchTokenProvider` loads, validates, refreshes, and supplies access tokens.
- `TwitchAuth` is a convenience facade that composes the pieces above.

Apps that already receive tokens from a backend can bypass Keychain storage entirely:

```swift
let twitch = TwitchClient(
    clientId: "<your client id>",
    tokenStore: InMemoryTokenStore(
        token: OAuthToken(accessToken: "<backend issued access token>")
    )
)
```

## Scope Catalog

`TwitchScope` includes the current Twitch API, EventSub, IRC chat, and PubSub-specific scope strings documented by Twitch.

Use `TwitchAuth.defaultScopes` for the small starter set used by TwitchKit convenience APIs, or `TwitchAuth.allScopes` when you need the complete catalog. OAuth helper methods prefer typed `[TwitchScope]` values and also provide raw-scope overloads for newly added Twitch scopes.

Request only the scopes your app needs. Twitch warns that requesting unnecessary scopes can put API access at risk.

### Common Scopes

| Use case | Typical scopes |
| --- | --- |
| Read authenticated user email | `.userReadEmail` |
| Read chat through Helix/EventSub | `.userReadChat` |
| Send chat messages | `.userWriteChat` |
| Subscribe to `channel.chat.message` over EventSub | `.userReadChat`, `.userBot` or broadcaster/moderator chat permissions depending on your app model |
| Read chatters | `.moderatorReadChatters` |
| Update channel title/category | `.channelManageBroadcast` |
| Read or manage channel points rewards | `.channelReadRedemptions`, `.channelManageRedemptions` |
| Moderate chat | `.moderatorManageBannedUsers`, `.moderatorManageChatMessages`, `.moderatorReadChatters` |
| Create polls or predictions | `.channelManagePolls`, `.channelManagePredictions` |
| Read subscriptions/followers | `.channelReadSubscriptions`, `.moderatorReadFollowers` |

Exact requirements vary by endpoint and whether the authenticated user is the broadcaster, moderator, or bot account, so check Twitch's endpoint docs before requesting production app review.

## Smoke Test Example

The package includes `TwitchKitSmokeTest`, a small command-line target for trying real Twitch API calls locally. It reads credentials from environment variables:

```bash
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<#Client ID#>"
export TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN="<#Access Token#>"
export TWITCH_BROADCASTER_ID="<#Broadcaster/User ID#>"

swift run TwitchKitSmokeTest all
swift run TwitchKitSmokeTest eventsub-list
swift run TwitchKitSmokeTest eventsub-connect
```

Side-effecting checks require explicit opt-in:

```bash
TWITCH_SMOKE_SEND_CHAT=1 swift run TwitchKitSmokeTest send-chat
TWITCH_SMOKE_CLEANUP=1 swift run TwitchKitSmokeTest eventsub-cleanup
```

Use a development Twitch application and avoid checking tokens into source control.

## Status

TwitchKit is pre-1.0 and the public API may change. Current coverage includes:

- OAuth helper flows and Keychain-backed token storage
- Broad Helix creator, chat, channel-management, moderation, media, and EventSub-management APIs
- EventSub WebSocket connection management and subscription re-creation
- EventSub subscription factories for the current Twitch subscription type catalog
- Typed models for Twitch's current EventSub subscription type catalog, with raw fallbacks for future Twitch types and decode-resilience
- Swift 6 `Sendable` annotations and actor-isolated auth/EventSub clients

Planned areas for expansion:

- iOS OAuth example app
- More focused examples for common broadcaster, moderator, and chat-bot workflows
- Continued DocC expansion as new Twitch API surfaces are added
